- All stats temperatures in June are higher than ones in December, but most of them did not have a big difference

  - Most of them are only 3-5 degree differences

- The minimum temperature in June is 9 degrees higher than December 

- The mean temperature in June is only about 4 degree higher than in December 

- The standard deviation in June is similar to the one in December 


## Summary

Although most of the temperature stats catergories (min, std, max, 25%, etc) are similar in both June and December, the mean temperature in December is 9 degree lower than in June. This might affect the business of surfing in Oahu as the weather is cooler and so less people visit the area. Therefore, the revenue for the ice cream shop business in December might be lower than in June.
